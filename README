The repository contains the code for the accelerated version of Airfoil.
The interesting part is in mesh_part.c which contains the partitioning and ordering code.
airfoil.cpp is a simple sequential implementation of Airfoil that showcases the logic of the program.
MaxCompilerDesign/ contains the Eclipse (MaxIDE) project for the FPGA design. The interesting files in there
are ResCalcKernel.java which specifies the kernel and ResControlSM.maxj which specifies the state machine
that controls the I/O to and from the chip.

A Makefile is provided for the host side. The code requires the METIS API, so you'll have to change
the METIS paths in the Makefile to point to your installation of METIS.

mesh_part.c also generates a top-level coloured graph with the halo region sizes between each pair of partitions
as edge-weights. This is in the form of a .dot graph. To make that graph use the make graph target, this will
put the generated graph in the graphs/ directory.

Note that currently the project is focused on accelerating the res_calc kernel of airfoil.
